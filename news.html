                <p>If there’s been one <span class="writing">fashion lesson</span> learned
                during lockdown, it’s that personal style doesn’t disappear in difficult times.Exactly the opposite happens, if Vogue’s street style portfolios and DIY challenges are any indication: Fashion lovers the world over are staying home, but they’re still getting dressed and celebrating the joys of clothing.
                </p>The spring collections,</span>which experienced a virtual makeover, provided plenty of inspiration for how to update our wardrobes at home.</p>
                <p>While we miss IRL fashion shows intensely—even thinking about the chaos of inching through traffic from one venue to another sparks wistful nostalgia—we’re certain that as we enter the new season, we’ll do it with a revitalized outlook on getting dressed.</p>
                <p>The designers we love certainly make the case for trying something lively and fresh, whether that means Nicolas Ghesquière’s roomy cargo pants at Louis Vuitton or Miuccia Prada’s micro miniskirts at Miu Miu.</p>
